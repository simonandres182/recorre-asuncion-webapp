            <p>Historical aspects</p>
                
            <p>The National Development Bank was created by Decree Law No. 281/1961. It is an autarchic entity with legal status, whose assets are considered legally separate from
                 State assets. The duration of the Bank will be for an indefinite period of time and the obligations it contracts are guaranteed by the Paraguayan State. This is what 
                 Article 1 of the Law of its creation says.</p>
                
            <p>It previously had several names:</p>
                
            <p>National Bank of Paraguay (1874)</p>
                
            <p>Bank of Paraguay(1878)</p>
                
            <p>National Bank of Paraguay S.A. (1881)</p>
                
            <p>National Bank of Paraguay (1883)</p>
                
            <p>BANCO AGRÍCOLA DEL PARAGUAY, created by Law of September 24, 1887 and incorporated into the Bank of Paraguay in 1947 by Decree No. 23,681 of December 23, 1947, ordering 
                the incorporation of the Agricultural Bank of Paraguay into the Bank of Paraguay -article 1°- and it is established that the assets and liabilities of the Banco Agrícola 
                del Paraguay be transferred to the Banco del Paraguay –article 2°-.</p>
                
            <p>BANK OF THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY, created in 1936 by Decree-Law No. 11 of February 22, 1936, which in turn had replaced the old OFFICE OF EXCHANGE created in 1916.</p>
                
            <p>BANCO DEL PARAGUAY, created in 1944 by Decree-Law No. 5130 of September 8, 1944. The Bank of Paraguay replaced the Bank of the Republic of Paraguay and later absorbed 
                the Agricultural Bank of Paraguay.</p>
                
            <p>National Development Bank (1961 to today)</p>
                
            <p>The building project was carried out by the professional architects Luis María de la Torre, Ferruccio Corbellani - Roberto Cardini and the Argentine construction company
                 Acevedo y Shaw S.A. and American Public Works Company. All the works were supervised by the Engineer Pascual A. Gagneten of Argentine nationality and by the Architect
                 Francisco Canese of Paraguayan nationality.</p>
                
            <p>The construction of the work began in 1942 and ended in 1944, being inaugurated on December 27, 1945. It had a delay with respect to the original execution plan, which 
                could not be fulfilled due to difficulties in the provision of some construction materials. construction due to World War II.</p>
                
            <p>The style of the building is neoclassical and monumentalist. In its architectural projection, the idea of ​​making a closed building that provides a sense of
                 security and protection prevailed, adjusting to the concept of a bank that existed at the time. The columns, topped with Doric capitals, on which the front of 
                 the building rests give the impression of solidity and the powerful backing of a firmly established institution, such as a bank should be. It has a large operating room,
                  surrounded by translucent windows.</p>
                
            <p>Many critics see in it a resemblance to the Buckingham Palace building but on a smaller scale. Undoubtedly there is some inspiration in the London palace, 
                in its volumetry, the central frontispiece, the levels, the symmetry, the main body and the lateral projections. Although in the details they have little in common.</p>
                
            <p>It was the first state building of this magnitude built after the War of 70. Before that, in the private sector there were some important constructions, such as the 
                Palacio Alegre, current headquarters of the Ministry of Finance and the German Pharmacy of Chile and Estrella, all works neoclassical.</p>
                
            <p>According to Resolution No. 89/99 dated November 14, 1999, the General Directorate of Cultural Assets, dependent on the Ministry of Education and Culture declared 
                the building as Part of the Historical Architectural and Natural Heritage and Part of the Cultural Heritage of the Republic and it is protected by 
                Law 946/82 on the Protection of Cultural Assets.</p>
                
            <p>Formal Aspects: From the point of view of applied technology: It is observed in the main facade of the building, the neoclassical style with the compositional lines
                 of Base-Body and Crowning, marking trends in the Asuncion urban landscape. This new building pattern is the result of an architecture adopted in our country at 
                 the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
                
            <p>Spatial and Technical Constructive Aspects: Typology U-shaped architectural plan Description The building is located on a large plot of land, raised with 
                respect to the street, and on the municipal boundary or sidewalk. According to data provided by the Technical Construction Department of said entity: The building is 
                made up of a main body and three upper floors and a sub-floor, whose fronts, main and sides measure 75 and 16 m. respectively, the average total height above sidewalk 
                level is 21m. The covered area of ​​the building is 7000 m2.</p>
                
            <p>For its construction, reinforced concrete was used in the foundations and structure, ceramic bricks in masonry, granite tile floors 
                and in the toilets common tiles were used. The doors inside the offices are made of wood. The windows are type metal shutters.</p>

            <p>On the main façade, the subdivision of the bodies of the building can be seen, different and organic from each other, standing out clearly in their surroundings. 
                The main access for the public is defined by three large sliding bronze doors with a semicircular arch, hierarchized by an important staircase. Its wide open spaces 
                (designed by the same construction company and equipped with careful landscaping) in addition to providing a beautiful perspective to the building, were conceived as 
                an extension of the large open space that constitutes the four large squares.</p>

            <p>The building is isolated from neighboring buildings by spacious gardens. Currently, its offices occupy the neighboring houses that were acquired by the Bank and were 
                refurbished inside without altering their facades. Example: House located on Cerro Corá street, corner of Yegros.</p>

            <p>Degree of Valuation (According to Municipal Ordinance JM 35/96) Architectural Value; Environmental value.</p>

            <p>Comments: The degree of valuation is consigned by the Historical Center Office of the Municipality of Asunción. It is part of the National Heritage by Law 5621/16, 
                Resolution No. 89/1999 of the General Directorate of Cultural Assets/VMC/MEC. The Municipality of Asunción has cataloged it through HJM Ordinances No. 28/96 and 35/96.</p>

            <p>Observations: The emblematic building located in the center of the city of Asunción, was conceived with an evocation of neoclassical style, which is manifested in the 
                adequate combination of the architectural elements that give the work sobriety and elegance without ostentation, qualities in accordance to the character of the "main bank of the Republic".</p>
