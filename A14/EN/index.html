            <p>Historical aspects</p>

            <p>Mr. Luiggi Patri, was a wealthy immigrant of Italian origin, a native of Genoa, who, as a young man, arrived in South America and dedicated himself to commerce. He arrived in Paraguay in the first decade of the 1900s.</p>
            
            <p>He had previously settled in Corrientes (Argentina), where he became a supplier of the Imperial Army of Brazil, for which he came to amass a great fortune, this activity he carried out until the conclusion of the 
                War against the Triple Alliance (1864- 1870).</p>
            
            <p>At the end of the war, he arrived in Paraguay, along with his business partner, Jorge Casaccia, and both continued the business as suppliers. Patri became an important landowner, providing capital 
                for the railway and even became the owner of the railway service, as well as founder of the Banco de Comercio, director of the National Bank of Paraguay and creator of an important yerba mate company.</p>
            
            <p>With effort and luck, he amassed a great fortune and acquired a property equivalent to one block (1 Ha.) He had a mansion built for his family home. He was also a great landowner and has been considered the
                 wealthiest man in post-war Paraguay. Luiggi Patri was one of the founders and honorary president of the "Societá Italiana di Mutuo Soccorso", an Italian charitable association founded in the year 1871.</p>
            
            <p>The migratory current began in the mid-nineteenth century and lasted until the 1930s; The largest contingent being that of the Swedes, followed by that of the Danes and to a lesser extent the Norwegians, Finns, Spaniards, Italians, etc.</p>
            
            <p>With reference to the study of the building: The builder of Swedish origin Karl Gustaff Rehnfeldt, who was in charge of the project and the construction with A. Pettirossi. The construction was 
                carried out according to the prevailing stylistic trend at that time: Italianate or Neoclassical, with a cloister or central internal courtyard, the style of the European mansions of the time, with a front between three (3) streets.</p>
            
            <p>The work is organized in two (2) floors or levels, (on Alberdi street) a large patio that separates it from the rear sector that has three (3) floors or levels, it is observed that all the levels 
                are interconnected by an important staircase and on the ground floor by the wide gallery.</p>
            
            <p>To carry out the building construction work, materials from our country were used: foundation stones, ceramic and plastered bricks, among others, which were reinforced with metal structures (vaults) for the upper floor (second floor).</p>
            
            <p>Upon the death of its owner, Mr. Patri (year 1904), the property passed into the hands of his heirs, and for some time the "Paraguayan Institute" functioned there, a private entity for cultural purposes, 
                founded in 1895. In 1912, the National Government acquired the property of the Patri family for the residence of the then President of the Republic Don Liberato Marcial Rojas Cabral, but said use never materialized.</p>
            
            <p>In 1913, the building was handed over to house the Post and Telegraph Office. Today it is called the National Post Office (DINACOPA). In 2018, the Ministry of Public Works and Communications (MOPC) 
                through the Public Works Directorate (DOP) called for a National Public Tender to carry out restoration work on the building.</p>
